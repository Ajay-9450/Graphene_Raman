        To preserve the flake from the damage we constrain the power of the laser to ~4 to ~0.04 mW incident power.

                        <li>The <m>E_{2g}</m> mode mode is a doubly degenerate phonon mode associated with the in-plane
                            vibrations of carbon atoms in the graphene lattice.</li>
                        <li>In this mode, the carbon atoms vibrate in opposite directions within the plane of the
                            hexagonal lattice, maintaining the lattice symmetry.
