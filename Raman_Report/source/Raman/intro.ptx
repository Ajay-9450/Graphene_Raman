  <title>Introduction to Raman Spectroscopy </title>



  <p>
  This is method based on the non-elastic scattering of the photons on intraction with sample. There are two type of scattering
    happen in molecules. First is elastic <term> Rayleigh Scattering,</term> second is <term>Raman Scattering.</term>
  </p>
  <p>The main difference between in these two scattering is wavelength of absorbed and radiated radiation. </p>
  <p>In <term>Rayleigh Scattering</term>, the wavelength of the scattered radiation remains the same as the incident wavelength.
    <me>\lambda_{incident} = \lambda_{radiate}</me>
  </p>

  <p>In Raman Scattering, the wavelength of the scattered radiation remains the different from the incident wavelength.
    So there are two case forms.<linebreak/>
    First case is when the wavelength of scattered radiation is less than the absorbed it is
    known as <term>Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering.</term>
    <me>\lambda_{\text{incident}} &lt; \lambda_{\text{Anti Stoke}}</me>
    Second case is when the wavelength of scattered radiation is grater than the absorbed it is known as <term>Stoke Raman
    Scattering.</term>
    <me>\lambda_{\text{incident}} &gt; \lambda_{\text{Stoke}}</me>
  </p>
