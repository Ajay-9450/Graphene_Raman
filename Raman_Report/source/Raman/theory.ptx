  <title>Theory Raman Spectroscopy </title>

  <p>

      For a molecule to exhibit a Raman effect, there must be a change in its electric dipole-electric dipole
      polarizability with respect to the vibrational coordinate corresponding to the rovibronic state. The intensity
      of the Raman scattering is proportional to this polarizability change. Therefore, the Raman spectrum (scattering
      intensity as a function of the frequency shifts) depends on the rovibronic states of the molecule.

      In Raman Spectroscopy, sample is illuminated under a light source from that electron of the molecules is excited
      to a virtual state and come back to its state immediate after the excitation by radiating the photon. Most of the
      time the absorbed and radiated energy is same but 1 in 10 million case the energy is not same and this is called
      Raman effect and the difference in energy is called Raman Shift.

        <term>Virtual State</term> in quantum physics, a virtual state is a very short-lived, unobservable quantum state.
        In many quantum processes a virtual state is an intermediate state, sometimes described as "imaginary" in a
        multistep process that mediates otherwise forbidden transitions. Since virtual states are not eigenfunctions of
        anything, normal parameters such as occupation, energy and lifetime need to be qualified. No measurement of a
        system will show one to be occupied, but they still have lifetimes derived from uncertainty relations.

    <p>
        Raman effect is based on the interation of the electron cloud of the atom with the external electric filed of the
        laser.
