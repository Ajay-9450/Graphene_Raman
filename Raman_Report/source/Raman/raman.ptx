  <title>Raman Spectroscopy</title>

  <introduction>
 <p>
   Raman spectroscopy is a spectroscopic technique typically used to determine vibrational modes of molecules, although
   rotational and other low-frequency modes of systems may also be observed. Raman spectroscopy is commonly used in
   chemistry to provide a structural fingerprint by which molecules can be identified.
