  <title>Introduction to Graphene </title>

  <p>Graphene can be obtained by the micro cleavege of the graphite crystal. The current interest
    in graphene can be attributed to
 three main reasons. First, its electron transport is described
 by the Dirac equation and this allows access to quantum
 electrodynamics in a simple condensed matter experiment
 . Second, the scalability of graphene devices to nano
dimensions makes it a promising candidate for
 applications, because of its ballistic transport at room
 temperature combined with chemical and mechanical
 stability. Remarkable properties extend to bilayer and
 few-layers graphene. Third, various forms of
 graphite, nanotubes, buckyballs, and others can all be
 viewed as derivatives of graphene </p>

  Graphene is a remarkable two-dimensional material consisting of a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal
  lattice. Discovered in 2004 by physicists Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov, graphene has since become a subject of
  intense scientific research due to its exceptional properties. It is the building block of other carbon-based materials
  such as graphite, carbon nanotubes, and fullerenes, and is often referred to as the "wonder material" because of its
  outstanding characteristics.</p>

<p>Graphene exhibits extraordinary electrical conductivity, mechanical strength, thermal conductivity, and optical
  transparency, making it a highly versatile material. Its unique structure, where each carbon atom is covalently bonded
  to three neighboring carbon atoms, contributes to its remarkable stability and performance. This material has opened
  up new possibilities in fields ranging from electronics and energy storage to biomedicine and materials science. As a
  result, graphene is considered a revolutionary material with the potential to significantly impact numerous industries
  in the coming years.
